# Python

| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üìà [Data Smoothing using Kalman Filter](https://github.com/daeukk/Data-Smoothing-Using-Kalman-Filter) | Feature Engineering | Removed outliers and smooths the data by applying the Kalman filter. In this implementation, the Kalman filter was imported from the Python library 'Pykalman'. | pandas, numpy, pykalman |
| ü§ñ [Training Models](https://github.com/daeukk/Training-Models) | Machine Learning | Trained three different machine learning models‚ÄîMultilayer Perceptron (MLP), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest (RF)‚Äîto predict pH levels based on a dataset of extracted color channel values. | pandas, numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, scikit-learn |
| ü¶† [Chronic Wound Detection using YOLO](https://github.com/daeukk/Chronic-Wound-Detection-Using-YOLO) | Machine Learning, Computer Vision | Aimed to detect chronic wounds using YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, and compare the results. | ultralytics, torch |

# Flutter

| Project Link | Dependencies used | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| üß† [CHROMA](https://github.com/daeukk/CHROMA-Color-based-Halochromic-Real-time-Optical-Monitoring-using-AI) | image picker, image,  cupertino_icons, color_models, sqflite, path, path_provider, share_plus, excel, syncfusion_flutter_xlsio, camera, gallery_saver, tflite_flutter, fl_chart | CHROMA (Color-based Halochromic Real-time Optical Monitoring using AI) is a mobile application designed to monitor the pH levels of chronic wounds in real time. The app integrates a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based computational intelligence model, successfully deployed using TensorFlow Lite for efficient on-device inference. | 
| üé® [Color Extractor App](https://github.com/daeukk/Color_Extractor_App) | image_picker, image, cupertino_icons, color_models, sqflite, path, path_provider, share_plus, excel, syncfusion_flutter_xlsio, camera, gallery_saver | This app extracts the average color channel values from three color spaces‚ÄîRGB, Lab, and HSV‚Äîand stores the extracted data in a tabular format, which can be exported as an Excel file. |

# Matlab

| Project Link | Area | Project Description |  
|---|---|---|
| ‚öôÔ∏è [Feature Selection](https://github.com/daeukk/Feature-Selection) | Feature Engineering | This MATLAB code performs feature selection using three algorithms: Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA), Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), and ReliefF. |
